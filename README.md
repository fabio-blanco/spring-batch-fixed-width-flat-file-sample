# Spring Batch Fixed Width Flat File Sample

A Sample batch application that reads a flat file with different record types, stores then 
into objects and prints then to the console.

This app is built in kotlin with [spring batch framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-batch).

## Running the app

Run the app by executing the following command from inside the project folder:

```shell
./gradlew bootRun
```

The app will run and look for a file named `sample-file.cred` in the classpath (a sample 
one is provided in the resources' directory).
The file will be processed and the result will be printed in the console.

and end with a trailer record. Each record is composed of 81 characters.
